ShipSync Community
==================
Advanced FedEx Web Services Integration for Magento
------------------

ShipSync is an extension that seeks to improve support for FedEx, providing accurate rate requests, address validation, shipment creation (from within Magento's admin panel), and label generation in a variety of formats (PDF, PNG, Thermal, etc.). This extension was born out of necessity, saving hours by eliminating the need to copy/paste addresses, tracking codes, and labels. Instead of swiveling between Magento and FedEx’s online site (or shipping manager), you can now perform the entire process from Magento’s admin panel.
